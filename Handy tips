1. Discerning results by a specific operator
  SELECT *
  FROM [ODS].[dbo].[OTH_CURRENCYRATES]
  WHERE [SourceCurrency] in ('MXN', 'CNY')
  AND [TargetCurrency] in ('EUR')
  and [Period] like '2008[0-12]%'

-- The specific operator here is that you want to have each result given back have the year 2018 and the periods between 0 and 12.
